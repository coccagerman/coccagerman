I'm a front end dev currently working with React, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
I'm also learning about backend technologies with node, express, graphQl, mongoDb and postgreSql.

Although I began my journey into programming learning about these technologies, I'm open to learn about pretty much anything, and in the near future I'd love get into mobile development, testing, other programming languages and cloud technologies.
