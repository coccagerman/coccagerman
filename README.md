I'm a full stack developer (typescript | react | react native | node | express) with one year of professional experience. I'm fluent in english and I'm currently studying computer science at UAI.

Although I began my journey into programming learning about these technologies, I'm open to learn about pretty much anything, and in the near future I'd love get into testing, other programming languages and cloud technologies.
